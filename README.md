# IpJugaad Projects
    This is a platform to connect students to their alumni by their projects.For the beginners who are in the colleges who needs to see their alumni projects specific to their colleges and University so they can see the level of projects they need to make and take the reference from it. There is no platform where we can specifically see our alumni projects and on the other hand if we need projects then we need to explicitly asked to the seniors which in some cases not very easily for the student who just entered in the college as introvert or shy personality.
